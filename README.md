> Compete against computer in rock paper scissors using actual hand gestures to play your moves.

## Milestone 1: The trained model
Used 'Teachable-Machine' to train a model to recognise whether my right hand is in the form of a 'rock', 'paper' or pair of 'scissors' or whether my hand is not present (i.e. 'nothing'). This will be used to enable the user to play their move in Milestone 4.

The model is under 'keras_model.h5' and the labels are listed under 'labels.txt'
